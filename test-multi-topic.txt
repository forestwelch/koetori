I need to text Sarah about brunch this weekend. Also I should buy milk and eggs from the store. Today I've been feeling really overwhelmed with work, just a lot of stress and I'm not sure how to handle it all. Oh and I drew the Nine of Pentacles this morning which reminded me to enjoy the fruits of my labor and take a break.
